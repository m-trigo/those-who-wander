    <h1>Those Who Wander</h1>

    <p>As a player, you determine your character's intentions. The GM, in turn, describes what happens in the fiction.
    </p>
    <p>When the GM doesn't know the exact outcome of an situation, they can use the game's systems to determine what
        happens.</p>

    <h2>Ability Checks</h2>
    <p>When trying to determine the outcome of physical activities, the game uses a combination of a dice roll and a set
        of numbers that represent of your character's attributes.</p>
    <p>First, the GM decides which physical attribute is the most relevant to the action.</p>
    <p>Then, you roll a twenty-sided die (a d<span class='numeric'>20</span>) and add that physical attribute's numeric
        value to the result.</p>
    <p>If the total exceeds <span class='numeric'>10</span>, your action succeeds.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, the action either succeeds with a compromise or fails.</p>
    <p>
        In some situations, your character wouldn't immediatelly know the result of the action they just attempted.
        When that happens, the GM will announce and make a secret roll that can invert the result of your dice roll (low
        numbers become better).
    </p>

    <h2>Advantage & Disadvantage</h2>
    <p>Ability checks for certain actions have an exceptional chance of success or failure and are said to have
        advantage or disadvantage.
    </p>
    <p>
        When that happens, the player rolls a second d20 when making the ability check.
        If the action has advantage, the higher of the two rolls is used. If the action has disadvantage, the lower
        of the two rolls is used instead.
    </p>
    <p>There are no degrees of advantage or disadvantage. With either one, you either have it or you don't.</p>
    <p>If an ability check would have have both advantage and disadvantage, then it has neither instead and it's a
        normal ability check</p>

    <h2>Ability Scores</h2>
    <p>The numeric values for your character's physical attributes always range from -<span class='numeric'>4</span>
        to +<span class='numeric'>4</span>. Those attributes are:
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>(STR) Strength</b>, which represents your characters’ physical power
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>(END) Endurance</b>, which represents your characters’ fortitude and resilience
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>(PER) Perception</b>, which represents your characters’ awareness
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>(AGI) Agility</b>, which represents your characters’ nimbleness and reflexes
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>(DEX) Dexterity</b>, which represents your character’s coordination
    </p>

    <p>Your character's ability scores are determined when creating the character. </p>
    <p>
        For each of the five ability scores, in order, roll <span class='numeric'>3</span>d<span
            class='numeric'>6</span> and use the following table to determine that
        ability score's value.
        If the sum of all five ability scores is less than zero, repeat this process.
    </p>

    <table border="1">
        <thead>
            <th>Total Roll</th>
            <th>Ability Score</th>

            <tr>
                <td><span class='numeric'>3</span> or <span class='numeric'>5</span></td>
                <td>-<span class='numeric'>3</span></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><span class='numeric'>8</span> or <span class='numeric'>9</span></td>
                <td>-<span class='numeric'>1</span></td>
            </tr>

            <tr>

    </table>

    <p>
        Since the value of your ability scores never changes, the number you need to roll to succeed each type of
        ability check is always the same.
        For each ability score, it's useful to write down the lowest roll you need to succeed its ability checks
        (<span class='numeric'>11</span>
        - Score).
    </p>

    <h2>Initiative</h2>
    <p>
        During time-sensitive situations where the order of actions is important,
        the descriptions and resolutions of those actions happen in structured rounds.
        At the beginning of the situation, you have a chance to acquire initiative. The order of when actions happen is:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class='numeric'>1</span>. Actions from player characters with initiative
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class='numeric'>2</span>. Actions from all non-player characters
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class='numeric'>3</span>. Actions from player characters without initiative
    </p>
    <p>
        You can acquire initiative through the fiction, an agility or perception check.
    </p>

    <h2>Effort & Stamina</h2>
    <p>
        Your can add effort to the total of an ability check at the cost of your character's stamina.
    </p>

    <table border="1">
        <thead>
            <th>Stamina</th>
            <th>Effort</th>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><span class='numeric'>1</span></td>
                <td><span class='numeric'>1</span></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><span class='numeric'>2</span></td>
                <td><span class='numeric'>3</span></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><span class='numeric'>3</span></td>
                <td><span class='numeric'>6</span></td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
        After a night of sleep, you have as much stamina as your character's health.
    </p>

    <h2>Health</h2>
    <p>
        Health is the measure of your character's vitality and distance from death.
        Your character's maximum health is <span class='numeric'>10</span> + your endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Characters die when their wounds bring their health to zero.
    </p>

    <h2>Wounds</h2>
    <p>
        Damage that your character suffers is tracked in your list of wounds.
        Each wound reduces your character's health by the amount of damage that caused it.
    </p>

    <p>
        For each day of uninterrupted rest, each of your characters’ treated wounds reduces <span
            class='numeric'>1</span> less health,
        until they fully heal.
    </p>

    <p>
        Wounds caused by more than <span class='numeric'>4</span> damage also reduce one of your ability
        scores by their health penalty
        (even after it started healing).
        The location of the wound determines which ability score is affected.
    </p>

    <table border="1">
        <thead>
            <th>Where</th>
            <th>Affected</th>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Head</td>
                <td>Perception</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Torso</td>
                <td>Endurance</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Arms</td>
                <td>Strength</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Hands</td>
                <td>Dexterity</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Legs</td>
                <td>Agility</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Inventory</h2>
    <p>
        Every item your character is carrying (not wearing) is listed in your inventory in one of four
        locations: hands, belt, backpack or strap.
        Meanwhile, you can only carry a limited amount of items in each of them:
    </p>
    <p>One item in each of your hands.</p>
    <p>One secured to your belt.</p>
    <p>One strapped to your backpack.</p>
    <p>
        How much you can carry in your backpack depends on your backpack and the weight and size of the items inside.
        Your backpack carrying capacity is represented as a three-by-two grid of squares.
        Items that can fit in a backpack will show how many slots they occupy.
